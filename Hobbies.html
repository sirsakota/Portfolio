    <Pre>
    I have multiple hobbies, varying from knitting, to drawing, learning languages and strength training.
    In weekly basis I have a balanced, scheduled time to spend on artistic and intellectual pursuits, as well as exercise.

    My oldest, and favorite hobby is drawing, besides video games. 
    Esecially digital illustrations and character designs for tabletop RGPs 
    as well as traditional sketching and painting. 
    I have been drawing ever since I could hold up a pen.
    I enjoy many other crafty hobbies as well, such as knitting and embroidery.

    I have always had a knack for languages as well. 
    I learned to read very early and when I ran out of books in finnish, I learned english.
    I have since independetly studied other languages, such as german, french and japanese.
