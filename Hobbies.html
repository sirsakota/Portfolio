    <p>I have multiple hobbies, varying from knitting, to drawing, learning languages and strength training.</p>
    <p>In weekly basis I have a balanced. scheduled time to spend on artistic and intellectual pursuits, as well as exercise.</p>
    <p>I believe it is important to have variety in your hobbies, to keep the mind fresh.</p>
    <Pre>My oldest, and favorite hobby is drawing, besides video games. 
    Especially digital illustrations and character designs for tabletop RPGs 
    as well as traditional sketching and painting. 
    I have been drawing ever since I could hold a pen.</Pre>
    <p>I enjoy many other crafty hobbies as well, such as knitting and embroidery.</p>
    <p>I have always had a knack for languages as well. I learned to read very early and thus in my thirst for more books, I learned english.
    I have since independetly studied other languages, such as german, dutch, french and japanese, although just the basics.
