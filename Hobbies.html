    <p>
    I have multiple hobbies, varying from knitting, to drawing, learning languages and strength training.<br>
    In weekly basis I have a balanced, scheduled time to spend on artistic and intellectual pursuits, as well as exercise.<br><br>

    My oldest, and favorite hobby is drawing, besides video games.<br> 
    Especially digital illustrations and character designs for tabletop RGPs <br>
    as well as traditional sketching and painting. <br>
    I have been drawing ever since I could hold up a pen.<br><br>
    <!--image of art or illustration asbackground-->
   
    I enjoy many other crafty hobbies as well, such as knitting and embroidery.<br><br>

    I have always had a knack for languages as well. <br>
    I learned to read very early and when I ran out of books in finnish, I learned english.<br>
    I have since independetly studied other languages, such as german, french and japanese.
