    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I am a 27 year old IT-student, with long-standing enthusiasm for computers.</p>
    <pre>Ever since my father brought home a computer that was twice the sice of my current one when I was hardly older than 7,
    I have been pursuing computer hobbies all the way through the years to studying it, as I started my studies in IT in 2020.
    I have retained my interest in gaming and by extension, coding, after my father allowed to play my very first video game on that PC.
    I also have a vast interest in artistic hobbies, like drawing.
    </pre>
    <p>My goal is to further pursue my education and start my career in programming and development.</p>
