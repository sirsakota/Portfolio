    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I am a 27 year old IT-student, with long-standing enthusiasm for computers.</p>
    <pre>Ever since my father brought home a massive computer that he allowed me to use for playing 
    when I was young.
    I have been pursuing computer hobbies all the way to studying it.
    I have retained my interest in gaming and by extension, coding.
    I also have a vast interest in artistic hobbies, like drawing</pre>
    <p>My goal is to further pursue my education and start my career in programming and development.</p>
