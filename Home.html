    <h2>About me</h2>

    <div class="div1">

    <p>
    I am a 27 year old IT-student, with long-standing enthusiasm for computers.<br><br>
    
    Ever since my father brought home a computer that was twice the sice of my current one when I was hardly older than 7,<br>
    I've had an interest in computers.<br>
    It was a huge box of a desktop computer, that took more than forever to boot<br>
    but I found myself exploring everything from video games<br>
    to the very basic paint application for hours.<br><br>
    
    I have retained my interest in gaming and by extension, coding, after my father allowed me<br> 
    to play my very first video game on that PC.<br>
    It was just a simple horse game but it started my love for games that has persisted through the years.<br>
    At some point I became interested in video game development, hoping to see<br>
    how the games were made.<br>
    And in my thirst for knowledge, I made myself familiar with browsers, the Windows OS and then<br>
    suddenly I was our family's go to free IT support.<br>
    And since I was doing it for free, why not make it a career for real, I thought.<br>
    I have been pursuing computer hobbies all the way through the years to studying it,<br> 
    as I started my studies in IT in 2020 since then.<br><br>
   
    My goal is to further pursue my education and start my career in programming and development.<br>
    After I finish my degree in programming, I am hoping to advance to university of applied sciences<br>
    in the same field.<br><br>
