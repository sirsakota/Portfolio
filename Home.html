<pre>
I am a 27 year old IT-student, with long-standing enthusiasm for computers.

Ever since my father brought home a computer that was twice the sice of my current one when I was hardly older than 7,
I have been pursuing computer hobbies all the way through the years to studying it, as I started my studies in IT in 2020.
I have retained my interest in gaming and by extension, coding, after my father allowed to play my very first video game on that PC.
I also have a vast interest in artistic hobbies, like drawing.

My goal is to further pursue my education and start my career in programming and development.</pre>
